# Week 4 – Advanced VAPT Operations

## Overview
Week 4 focuses on real-world penetration testing practices including exploitation, API security, privilege escalation, mobile testing, and a full simulated engagement.

The goal is to demonstrate technical depth, attack chaining, and professional reporting aligned with industry methodologies such as PTES.
