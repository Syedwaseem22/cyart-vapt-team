# Capstone Project: Full VAPT Engagement

## Practical Application
This capstone simulates an end-to-end penetration testing engagement following PTES methodology.

---

## Objectives
- Perform reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation.
- Validate vulnerabilities.
- Recommend remediation.
- Communicate findings to technical and non-technical audiences.

---

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Metasploit
- OpenVAS
- Burp Suite

## Simulation Target
HackTheBox VM

Example exploit:

## Activity Log

| Timestamp           | Target IP     | Vulnerability | PTES Phase    |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2025-08-30 15:00:00 | 192.168.4.134 | VSFTPD RCE    | Exploitation |

## Remediation Strategy
- Apply vendor patches  
- Enforce strong input validation  
- Implement least privilege  
- Re-scan using OpenVAS

## Executive Summary (Sample)

The engagement identified critical remote code execution and authorization weaknesses. Attackers could gain system-level access and pivot internally. Immediate remediation, patch management, and segmentation are required to reduce enterprise risk.

---

## Stakeholder Brief (150 words)

The test demonstrated that external attackers could compromise systems due to outdated services and weak validation controls. Successful exploitation provided deep access to sensitive environments. Addressing these issues requires urgent patching, better monitoring, and stricter privilege management to prevent business disruption or data loss.
