# Advanced Exploitation Lab

## Practical Application
This lab focuses on chaining exploits, writing custom proof-of-concepts, and bypassing modern defensive mechanisms in controlled environments.

---

## Objectives
- Perform multi-stage exploitation.
- Modify public exploits into working PoCs.
- Practice defense evasion techniques such as ASLR bypass.
- Document findings professionally.

---

## Tools Used
- Metasploit
- Python
- Ghidra

## Exploit Chain Simulation

**Target VM:** VulnHub (Mr. Robot)

Example module:


### Activity Log

| Exploit ID | Description       | Target IP     | Status  | Payload     |
|------------|------------------|---------------|---------|------------|
| 007        | XSS to RCE Chain | 192.168.43.132 | Success | Meterpreter |

## Custom Proof of Concept (50 words)

A public buffer overflow exploit was adapted to match the vulnerable binary’s memory layout. Offsets were recalculated, bad characters removed, and shellcode updated. The revised script achieved reliable control of the instruction pointer and spawned a reverse shell.

## ASLR Bypass via ROP 

Return-oriented programming gadgets were identified using Ghidra. A chain was constructed to pivot execution toward controlled memory and call system functions without injecting code. This allowed successful execution despite address randomization protections.
