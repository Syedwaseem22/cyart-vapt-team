# Post-Exploitation and Evidence Collection

## Overview
This lab focuses on post-exploitation activities following successful system compromise. The objective was to demonstrate privilege escalation, evidence collection, and forensic integrity maintenance.

## Environment
- Target System: Windows (Lab VM)
- Access Method: Meterpreter reverse TCP session
- Privilege Level Achieved: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

## Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework (Meterpreter)
- Wireshark
- sha256sum / Get-FileHash
- Standard Kali utilities

## Key Activities
- Local privilege escalation using misconfigured installer permissions
- Collection of forensic artifacts (traffic logs, screenshots, registry hives)
- Hashing of evidence using SHA-256
- Documentation of chain-of-custody procedures

## Evidence Collected
- Network traffic captures
- Meterpreter screenshots
- Registry hives (SAM, SYSTEM, SECURITY)
- Keystroke logs and command history

## Outcome
This lab reinforces the importance of proper post-exploitation handling, evidence integrity, and forensic documentation in professional penetration testing engagements.

⚠️ All actions were conducted in an isolated lab environment.
