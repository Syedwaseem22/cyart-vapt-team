# Advanced Exploitation Lab

## Overview
This lab demonstrates advanced exploitation techniques through a chained attack scenario in a controlled lab environment. The objective was to show how multiple vulnerabilities can be combined to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE), even when individual issues appear moderate in severity.

## Environment
- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Target: Metasploitable2 VM
- Target IP: 192.168.43.131
- Network: Isolated lab

## Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework
- Python
- Exploit-DB
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

## Key Activities
- Identification of stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities
- Session abuse through client-side exploitation
- Exploit chaining leading to RCE
- Customization of public PoC exploits from Exploit-DB
- Meterpreter session handling

## Findings
- Chained exploitation resulted in successful RCE
- CVE-2021-22205 (GitLab RCE) analyzed and customized
- Demonstrated how XSS can lead to full system compromise

## Outcome
The lab highlights the real-world risk of exploit chaining and emphasizes the importance of secure coding, patch management, and defense-in-depth strategies.
