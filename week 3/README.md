# Week 3 – Advanced Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

## Overview
Week 3 focuses on advanced penetration testing concepts, including exploitation techniques,
web application security testing, post-exploitation activities, and a full capstone project.
This week builds upon reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning to simulate real-world attack scenarios.

All activities were performed in a **controlled lab environment** strictly for **educational purposes**.

## Modules Included

### 🔹 Advanced Exploitation Lab
- Exploiting confirmed vulnerabilities using automated and manual techniques
- Use of Metasploit framework
- Payload delivery and session handling

### 🔹 Web Application Testing
- Identification of common web vulnerabilities
- SQL Injection, XSS, authentication issues
- Use of tools such as Burp Suite, sqlmap, and Nikto

### 🔹 Post-Exploitation
- Privilege escalation techniques
- Persistence mechanisms
- Evidence collection and impact assessment

### 🔹 Capstone Project
- End-to-end VAPT lifecycle
- Reconnaissance → Scanning → Exploitation → Reporting
- Professional documentation and remediation recommendations
